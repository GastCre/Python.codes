# Python codes
This is a repository for my Python projects:
- [Image processing: black & white to color](/Image%20processing:%20black%20&%20white%20to%20color): black & white to color: final project from the bachelor course "Image processing and artificial vision". The code creates a map from a known colored image to its black and white version, and then applied the map to target black and white images. I implemented the code in iOS using the Pythonista app, which required a modification of the code. This project was awarded a 10/10.
