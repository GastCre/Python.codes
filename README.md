# `Python` codes
This is a repository for my Python projects:
- [Image processing: black & white to color](/Image%20processing:%20black%20&%20white%20to%20color): final project from the bachelor course "Image processing and artificial vision" written in `Python 2.7`. The code creates a map from a known colored image to its black and white version, and then apply the map to target black and white images. I implemented the code in iOS using the Pythonista app, which required a modification of the code. This project was awarded a 10/10.
- Automatic detection of SFE: this code takes data from an electromagnetic observatory and automatically detects the presence of a solar flare event (SFE). It is written in `Python 2.7` and it is part of a collaboration with the Ebre Observatory as an undergraduate. This code is at the core of the publication "[Automatic detection of Sfe: a proposal](https://angeo.copernicus.org/articles/35/799/2017/)" and inspired [follow-up work](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/13/2/199), which revealed that, in combination to other methods, yields a 90.9% of true detections.
